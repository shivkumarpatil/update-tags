This GitHub Actions workflow file is designed to automatically update tags in your repository whenever a new tag is pushed that matches the pattern v*.*.*. Here’s a breakdown of what each part does:

Workflow Name and Trigger
name: Update Tags

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - v*.*.*

name: The name of the workflow is “Update Tags”.
on.push.tags: The workflow is triggered whenever a tag matching the pattern v*.*.* (e.g., v1.0.0, v2.1.3) is pushed to the repository.
Job Definition
jobs:
  generate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write

jobs.generate: Defines a job named “generate”.
runs-on: Specifies that the job will run on the latest version of Ubuntu.
permissions.contents.write: Grants write permissions to the contents of the repository, allowing the job to create and push tags.
Steps
Checkout Code
- name: Checkout
  uses: actions/checkout@v4

Uses the actions/checkout action to check out the repository’s code.
Parse Semantic Versioning (Semver)
- name: Parse semver
  uses: madhead/semver-utils@40bbdc6e50b258c09f35f574e83c51f60d2ce3a2 # v4.0.0
  id: version
  with:
    version: ${{ github.ref_name }}

Uses the madhead/semver-utils action to parse the semantic versioning of the tag that triggered the workflow.
The parsed version information is stored with the ID version.
Update Tags
- name: Update tags
  run: |
    TAGS='v${{ steps.version.outputs.major }} v${{ steps.version.outputs.major }}.${{ steps.version.outputs.minor }}'
    
    for t in $TAGS; do
      git tag -f "$t"
      git push origin ":$t" 2>/dev/null || true
      git push origin "$t"
    done

Defines a shell script to create and push new tags based on the major and minor versions of the parsed tag.
TAGS: Creates two new tags: one for the major version (e.g., v1) and one for the major.minor version (e.g., v1.0).
for loop: Iterates over the tags, forcefully creates them (git tag -f "$t"), deletes any existing remote tags (git push origin ":$t"), and then pushes the new tags to the remote repository (git push origin "$t").
Purpose
This workflow ensures that whenever a new version tag (e.g., v1.2.3) is pushed, it automatically creates and updates tags for the major version (v1) and the major.minor version (v1.2). This can be useful for maintaining versioning consistency and making it easier to reference different versions of your code.
